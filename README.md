# Widget Editor+

Widget Editor+ is a development and diagnostics suite for ServiceNow Service Portal developers. It replaces the standard widget editor with one built around the Microsoft Monaco Editor and ServiceNow-specific IntelliSense, alongside dedicated tools for version diffing (**Compare+**), runtime portal diagnostics (**Debug Context Menu**), cross-table source search (**Code Search+**), and AI context extraction (**Widget Editor+ Assistant**).

> **Zero External Dependencies**: Built entirely with native ServiceNow platform capabilities. All editor functionality, language tooling, and diagnostics rely strictly on libraries already present within the ServiceNow platform (Monaco Editor, AngularJS, Bootstrap, and standard ServiceNow client/server APIs).

### 2. Compare+

Compare record versions from the editor, Debug Context Menu or version lists.

- Side-by-side code and condition-builder diffs.
- Readable reference and list values.
- Export both versions as XML, including unsaved changes where applicable.

---

### 3. Debug Context Menu

Use **Ctrl + Right-Click** on a Service Portal widget to inspect it.

- Navigate nested widgets and open editors or platform records.
- Inspect generation times, scopes, data and instance customisations.
- Choose Enhanced, Standard or Off in User Preferences.

---

## Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- ServiceNow SDK (`@servicenow/sdk`)
- A ServiceNow instance to deploy to

### Build with ServiceNow SDK
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tchris3/widget-editor-plus.git
   cd widget-editor-plus
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the Fluent source definitions into update set XML:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The compiled metadata is output to the `dist/app/` directory.

### Direct Deployment
Deploy the application directly to your configured ServiceNow instance:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
*(This executes `now-sdk install` to authenticate and apply the application package to the target instance).*

Alternatively, deploy the retrieved update set XML artifact located in the latest [GitHub Release](https://github.com/tchris3/widget-editor-plus/releases) via **System Update Sets → Retrieved Update Sets**.

## End-to-End Testing

Widget Editor+ features a comprehensive Playwright test suite validating editor features, language services, and context menus against a live ServiceNow instance.

1. Create a local `.env` configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Set your instance credentials:
   ```env
   SN_INSTANCE_URL=https://devXXXXX.service-now.com
   SN_USERNAME=admin
   SN_PASSWORD=your_pdi_password
   SN_PORTAL_SUFFIX=sp
   ```
3. Install browser binaries and run the tests:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   npm run test:e2e        # Headless mode
   npm run test:e2e:ui     # Interactive UI runner
   ```

*Note: Test fixtures automatically seed and tear down necessary test records via the ServiceNow Table API.*
