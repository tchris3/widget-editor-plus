# Widget Editor+ development guide

## Working conventions

- Do not commit or push unless the user explicitly asks. Leave edits uncommitted until they are ready.
- Use Australian English. Keep README feature summaries brief; configuration details belong in `CONFIGURATION.md`.
- Keep this guide project-specific and platform-neutral. Do not document personal hosting arrangements, remote mappings, or repository visibility settings.

## Project context

ServiceNow global application built with the Fluent SDK, AngularJS and Monaco. `now.config.json` defines the scope and application ID; `package.json` defines versions and commands.

Edit source under `src/fluent/generated/` despite its name. `.now.ts` files declare metadata; scripts may be inline or loaded from adjacent `.js` files with `Now.include()`. `keys.ts` maps record identifiers to sys_ids. Build output is in `dist/`; release packages are in `target/`.

Key paths beneath `src/fluent/generated/`:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `other/sys-ui-page/` | Widget Editor+, Compare+, Assistant, Code Search+ and Properties pages. `.now.ts` files declare metadata and include adjacent `.html` and `.client.js` files; the editor and Compare+ metadata filenames use sys_ids. |
| `other/sp-widget/sp_widget_widget_editor_debug_menu/` | Debug Context Menu template, scripts and styles. |
| `client-development/ui-script/` | Monaco bootstrap, language services and code actions. |
| `server-development/script-include/` | Server APIs for the editor, Assistant, Code Search and Markdown export. |
| `server-development/ui-action/widget_editor_markdown_copy.client.js` | Markdown tree construction, formatting and clipboard export. |
| `properties/` | System properties and category links. |
| `security/`, `user-interface/` | ACLs, modules and navigation metadata. |

## Commands and checks

Run from the repository root:

Use Node.js 24 LTS, as specified in `.nvmrc` and `package.json`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Compile Fluent metadata; run after source changes and inspect relevant `dist/app/update/` output. |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit suite; some checks launch a browser. Use relevant test files during development. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright against the instance configured in `.env`; fixtures create and remove test records. |
| `npm run pack` | Package the build and generate retrieved update-set XML in `target/`. |
| `npm run deploy` | Install on the configured ServiceNow instance. |
| `npm run transform` / `npm run types` | Transform metadata / refresh instance typings. |

Documentation-only edits need diff and link checks, not a build.

Pull requests run the build and unit suite through the `Build and unit tests` check. Require this check in the target branch's protection settings before merging. Release workflows also run the unit suite before packaging or publishing; never bypass a failing check.

## Platform pitfalls

- Modules opening UI pages must use `ui_page.do?sys_id=<verified sys_id>`, never a named `.do` endpoint. Resolve IDs from `keys.ts` or the actual record.
- Jelly can turn CSS `>` selectors inside UI-page `<style>` blocks into literal `&gt;`, breaking them. Use descendant selectors.
- Embedded JavaScript has two escaping layers. When generated JS needs an escaped backtick, use three backslashes before it in the outer TypeScript template literal; verify the compiled output.
- Debug Menu preferences use `we_debug_menu_prefs`; shared editor preferences use `monaco_plus.user_prefs`. Preserve unrelated settings when saving. Pass preference objects directly to `$scope.server.get`, without pre-stringifying.
- Markdown groups form a table hierarchy: reject duplicate child placements and cycles. Primary display fields use commas for ordered fallbacks and periods to join fields on the same record; additional fields are separate. Retain server-side validation when changing the Properties editor.

## Releases

### Release-note writing style

- Use short product headings and brief bullets in plain Australian English.
- Start bullets with direct verbs such as Add, Improve, Copy, Mark or Update.
- Summarise user-visible capabilities. Combine related changes into one bullet instead of listing every implementation detail or edge case.
- Omit internal terminology, validation mechanics, test results and minor UI details unless they are essential to understanding the change. Keep technical validation in the PR.
- Describe changes relative to the previous release. Omit fixes to issues introduced and resolved during development of the current release.

Annotated tags are the source of truth for published release notes. Keep the annotation and release body identical, using concise product sections matching recent releases and Australian English. Use `git tag -a --cleanup=verbatim -F <notes-file>` to preserve Markdown headings.

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yaml`, which builds and publishes the application ZIP and retrieved update-set XML. Verify workflow success, both assets and matching notes before reporting completion.
